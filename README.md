### A Cross Platform Flight Controller - ( In Development for ESP32 )

Currently in a Development State and This Branch isn't stable.

<b>Goals For the First Release:</b>
* Framework
  * Implement a Factory System to Create/Destroy Modules and Drivers.
  * Replace all hard coded platform specific classes with interfaces.
  * Implement a Observer to communicate between modules and drivers.
* Modules
  * Gyro Module should retrieve the accurate angle without drifting.
  * WiFi Module to report the connection status to observers.
  * Altitude Module needs to be integrated
* Drivers
  * I2C Driver for ESP32 is hard coded to use in master mode. This should be flexible.
  * BLDC Driver for ESP32 doesn't seem to generate the correct PWM signals. This should be fixed.
* Flight Controller
  * Implement a State Machine to Control the flight status. 
  * BLDC Startup Routine.
  * Drive Motors at a Specific Speed
  * Altitude Hold
  * Self Balance with Gyro's Angle Values
  * Connect to the Mobile Unity App via UDP
  
A Long way to go before I reach these goals, But This list helps me focus on one goal at a time and clear it.
